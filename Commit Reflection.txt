Commit Reflection
- Uploaded files
- Created basic item store with purchase logic by copy and pasting the code given for the assignment into VS.
- Did a test to see if the repository would update by adding a letter to one of the store items. Successful.
- Reverted the changes by taking the extra letter out of the store item "Magic Rings." 
= Uploaded a .gitignore file
- Uploaded a README.md file

What I learned about Git/GitHub:

I learned that GitHub makes it easier for teams to make edits to their projects by not having to upload the entire project files which can be time consuming.
It allows for revisions and edits to be seen on each file for the team which can make coordinating a lot simpler.
You can Push, Pull, and Commit the changes for everyone to see.
